# React Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to have a portfolio that uses React so when I present this to recruiters/employers, they will see I know how to use modern technology!
I built this project so then I will have a portfolio to use that will illustrate my current skills and knowledge!
The problem that this solves is personally for me to have a working, neat, and presentable deployed portfolio while using current technology (React).
I learned how to create a header, nav, footer, add images to cards properly (used cloudinary), connect a pdf for my resume, connect a contact page, all while using React!
